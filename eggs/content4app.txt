Mission statement

(Allowing people to be a part of something bigger than themselves)

to combine information on environmental issues while also giving individuals an opportunity to act upon this information (first draft)

Why our company exists: Reduce our negative impact in regards to environmental crises

What makes us different: We give anyone the ability to create change (organizing their own events)



What are the problems our users may have?

Enviormental Crisis (all of our lives are in danger and it helps to contribute to preventing this in any way you can)

Lack of community (gives a new alternative to network while helping the environment and others)

unable to commit to a job (still able to get benefits (minuscule))

no experience in a certain field (you can volunteer for something related to what you want to do)

Rockaway beach clean up! 10:00 AM 10/29/2019 73/100 *people*
    - //sponsor
    - We implore you all to join us as we make our way across the shore in an attempt to prevent litter from entering the ocean.
    Litter poses a great threat to marine life. Marine mammals, seabirds, and fish die from 
    being either entangled in or ingesting litter. With your help we can make the change we wish to see in the world.
    (We will be able to provide everyone with equipment, and you even get a *REALLY* cool shirt!)
