EnveeNYC 
Our vision: a world with less pollution and waste and more cooperation and sustainability.
Our mission: to drive passion for a better, cleaner environment.
Our role: to provide a platform for amazing people who share this vision and want to help.
The world is full of people who are willing to make a difference, but many don’t know how. EnveeNYC bridges that gap. Our application provides the accessibility and network to allow environmentally conscious citizens to organize their mission for a better world.

Education: 
7.5% of our waste stream consists of plastic film such as supermarket bags.

If every person in New York picked up one plastic bottle per day, we could reduce plastic polution by 25% by 2025.

"The Ocean Cleanup Device in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch Is Finally Working"
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a soupy concoction of plastic debris that formed 
in a convergence point for gyres, or massive ocean currents, in the Pacific Ocean. 
The patch covers a swath of water three times the size of France and it’s become 
emblematic of the larger crisis of plastic pollution affecting the ocean. Each year,
an estimated 8 to 12 million tons of plastic enter marine environments, and there 
are more than 5 trillion pieces of microplastic in the ocean. 
The organization developed a low-energy way to deal with the problem. 
A massive floating device sits in the water and takes advantage of the movement of 
gyres to collect plastic waste in a 3-meter plastic skirt. After a few weeks of plastic 
ccumulation, a boat travels to the device and removes the waste, then delivers it a 
recycling facility. The Ocean Cleanup then coordinates with manufacturers to create 
products from the plastic waste, which can then be sold.

"Last month volunteers came together to pick up millions of items of trash from beaches"
Last year’s International Coastal Cleanup collected more than 20 million items of 
rubbish, from plastic bags to bottle caps. 
Oceanographer and climate scientist Dr Erik van Sebille told Sky News beach cleans 
were a “very effective way of cleaning up the ocean”.
"So by taking the plastic when it's on the beach, you remove it from the marine system."

Use this plastic calculator to determine how much plastic you may be producing with the calculator below.
(you may not even realize how much it could really be!)

By noticing how many plastic, single-use items we rely on, we can find ways to reduce our usage over time by making small changes. Some recommendations from the National Resource Defense Council suggest to
> Bringing your own reuseable utensils/straws as well as bottles
> Bringing your own grocery totes 
> Using natural exfoliants instead of microbeads 
> Cooking instead of ordering in
> Purchasing secondhand items instead of buying new
> Buying items in bulk
